# Covid_19 Exploratory Data Analysis Using SQL
Excel, SQL, & Tableau


The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy. The pandemic, which began in early 2020, has caused widespread disruption to businesses, supply chains, and financial markets.Some of the impact on Global Economy include; Economic Recession, Unemployment, Supply Chain Disruptions and so on.

In this project, I analyzed and explored covid data Starting from 8th January, 2020 to 19th April, 2023. with Excel, SQL using Micrsoft SQL Server Management Studio. 
Data Source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) 

I will advise to download the latest dataset from the site.  

I employed Tableau for data visualization (dashboard).

You can interact with the dashboard and make some queries:

## Trends and Insights:

1. **Total Deaths per Continent:**
The bar chart on the dashboard shows that the highest number of deaths due to Covid 19 has occurred in Europe, followed by Asia, North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania. This trend shows that Europe and Asia were hit the hardest by the pandemic, while Oceania was the least affected continent.

2. **Percent of Population Affected per Country:**
The line chart of the population affected per country shows the trend of how many countries experienced a surge in Covid 19 cases in 2020, but the numbers gradually decreased in 2022. However, there was a slight increase in cases in early 2023. This trend indicates that many countries were able to effectively control the spread of the virus, but there is still a need for continued vigilance and precautionary measures.

3. **Percentage of Population Infected by Country:**
The map showing the percentage of the population affected by location (country) indicates that many countries have been severely impacted by the pandemic. The highest percentage of population affected was in Cyprus, followed by San Marino, Austria, and Faeroe Islands. This trend highlights the fact that some countries have been hit harder than others and that there is a need for global cooperation in managing the pandemic.

**Global Summary:**
The table on the dashboard provides a global summary of total cases, total deaths, and death percentage. As of April 19, 2023, there have been 764,104,167 confirmed cases of Covid 19 globally, resulting in over 6.9 million deaths. The death percentage globally stands at 0.91. 
This trend shows the magnitude of the pandemic  has been reduced and there is still need for continued efforts to mitigate its impact to the minimal.


## Conclusion and Recommendations

In conclusion, the exploratory analysis using Sequel gives insights to some global questions, and dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the impact of Covid 19 globally. The trends and insights obtained from the dashboard highlight the need for global cooperation in managing the pandemic, continued vigilance, and precautionary measures to prevent a resurgence of the virus.

Based on the insights obtained from the dashboard, I recommend that governments and organizations around the world continue to implement effective measures to control the spread of the virus, including vaccination campaigns, testing, and contact tracing. Additionally, there is a need for increased investment in healthcare systems to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on communities.

Overall, the Tableau dashboard provides a valuable tool for analyzing and understanding the impact of Covid 19 on a global scale, and it is my hope that the insights obtained from the dashboard will inform decision-making in managing the pandemic.
